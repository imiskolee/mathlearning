#Linear Equation

###Whatâ€˜s Linear Equation?
	a linear equation in the variables X1,X2,X3....Xn is an equation that can be writeten 
	in the form :
	a1x1 + a2X3 + a3X3 + ... + anXn = b 
	where  b  and the cofficients a1 .. an are the real or complex numbers,usually know in 	advance. The subscript n may be any positive intgger.
	

###System Of Linear Equation
	 a system of linear equations is a collection of one or more linear questions involving the
	 same variables say x1 ... xn.
	 like :
	 
\\[ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_nx_n = \mathbf{b} \\]


###Equivalent Linear System
	tow linear systems called equivalent if they have the same solution set.Thatis,each solutionof the first linear system is a solution of the seconed linear system,and each solution of the second linear system is a solution of the first.
	
	
###Consitent And Inconsitent
	A system of linear equations is said to be consitent if it has either solution or infinitely
	many solution .a system is inconsitent if it has no solution.
	

####example a Matrix	
	
\\[\mathbf{V}\_1   = \begin{vmatrix} 
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\
 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\
\end{vmatrix} \\]
